# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Cpp
This repository contains problems for Data Structures and Algorithms which will be helpful for interviews. The codes are written in C++

The topics covered are - 
1. Problems on Arrays
2. Linked List
3. Stack and Queues
4. Trees
5. Heaps
6. Problems on String
7. Greedy technique
8. Dynamic Programming
9. Backtracking
10. Graphs


TODO - 
1. Change the find next greater element in linked list section as it is wrong code.
2. Inorder traversal without recursion and without stack
3. Serialize and deserialize binary tree
4. Pattern (complex star pattern codes 3-4 codes)
