# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Cpp
This repository contains problems for Data Structures and Algorithms which will be helpful for interviews. The codes are written in C++

The topics covered are - 
1. Problems on Arrays
2. Linked List
3. Stack and Queues
4. Trees
5. Heaps
6. Problems on String
7. Greedy technique
8. Dynamic Programming
9. Backtracking
10. Graphs
11. Divide and Conquer
12. Trie 

TODO - 
1. Change the find next greater element as it is wrong code. (linked list folder)
2. Inorder traversal without recursion and without stack (trees folder)
3. Serialize and deserialize binary tree (trees folder)
4. Finding k most frequent words in a text file (heaps)
5. Find duplicates in array in O(n) time. Array has elements from 0 to N-1 (array folder)
6. Matrix spiral traversal (array folder)
